# Uber-PowerBI-Dashboard-

Data Analysis Project | SQL + Python + Power BI | 150,000 Ride Bookings

📊 Project Overview
Analyzed 150,000 Uber ride bookings to identify operational inefficiencies and revenue optimization opportunities using SQL, Python statistical analysis, and Power BI dashboards.
Key Finding: Identified supply-demand gaps in specific zones during peak hours, representing ₹18-22 Lakhs weekly revenue opportunity.

🎯 Business Problem
Uber operations faced:

-25% cancellation rate across bookings
-Unknown root causes of cancellations
-Need to optimize driver deployment
-Revenue leakage from failed bookings

Goal: Identify actionable patterns to reduce cancellations and increase revenue.

🛠️ Tools Used

SQL - Data extraction and aggregation
Python - Statistical analysis (pandas, scipy, matplotlib)
Power BI - Interactive dashboard

🔍 Key Findings
-Cancellation Analysis

Overall Rate: 25% of bookings cancelled
Peak Issues: Certain zones show 72% higher cancellation rates
Root Cause: Driver supply constraints in specific areas/times

-Customer Insights

First-month Churn: 94.6% of customers don't return
Retention Opportunity: ₹12.9 Cr through targeted programs
Segmentation: 74% one-time users vs 26% repeat customers

-Revenue Opportunities

Total Identified: ₹21.6 Cr annual optimization potential
Top Priority: Driver deployment to high-demand zones
Expected ROI: 1,864% on recommended interventions
